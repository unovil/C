# Overview
- C provides decision-making capability in form of if statement
```
if ( expression )
    program statement
```

- For example, translating "If it is hot, I'll go swimming" is easy
```
if ( it is sunny )
    i'll go swimming
```
- curly brackets are needed for compound statements inside the if block
